Team Profile Generator
Description
Team Member Profile Generator. 
I used Node along with jest, the inquirer, and FS packages.

When node index is typed into the console it will take you through a series of questions.
 Once completed that data will be used to write an HTML file into the dist folder that will have cards for each team member.
 The HTML file will display the team members with the proper information and have working links for their emails and github if applicable.
